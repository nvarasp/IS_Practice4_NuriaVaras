 Practice 4 - Multiple displays
I used the Roll a ball tutorial from P1 and implemented:
- A setup to render the image in a panoramic display, so when two game windows (display 1 and display 2) and opened side to side, you can see the game from these two continuos screens, where display 1 shows the left side and display 2 the right one. 
- I implemented a mini map camera that shows the game from the top view
- I implemented a render texture in a cube in the scene from the view of the minni map camera. So when playing you see the game scene from the main camera and in the left top corner you see a screen with the top view.
